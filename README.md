JDBC or Java Database Connectivity is a specification from Sun microsystems that provides a standard abstraction(that is API or Protocol) for java applications to communicate with various databases. It provides the language with java database connectivity standard. It is used to write programs required to access databases. JDBC along with the database driver is capable of accessing databases and spreadsheets. The enterprise data stored in a relational database(RDB) can be accessed with the help of JDBC APIs.

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

APIs are very versatile and can be used on web-based systems, operating systems, database systems and computer hardware.
